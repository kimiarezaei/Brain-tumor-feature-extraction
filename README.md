# Brain tumor feature extraction

This repository provides code for extracting texture-based features from **brain CT images** using MATLAB.

The feature extraction process focuses on:
- **Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM)** features
- **Dominant Gray-Level Run Length Matrix (GLRLM)** features

These handcrafted texture features are designed to capture spatial intensity patterns in brain CT images and are commonly used in medical image analysis tasks.
